description: "A Journal of the Plague Year is a novel by Daniel Defoe, first published\
  \ in March 1722.\nThis novel is an account of one man's experiences of the year\
  \ 1665, in which the Great Plague or the bubonic plague struck the city of London.\
  \ The book is told somewhat chronologically, though without sections or chapter\
  \ headings.\nPresented as an eyewitness account of the events at the time, it was\
  \ written in the years just prior to the book's first publication in March 1722.\
  \ Defoe was only five years old in 1665, and the book itself was published under\
  \ the initials H. F. and is probably based on the journals of Defoe's uncle, Henry\
  \ Foe.\nIn the book, Defoe goes to great pains to achieve an effect of verisimilitude,\
  \ identifying specific neighborhoods, streets, and even houses in which events took\
  \ place. Additionally, it provides tables of casualty figures and discusses the\
  \ credibility of various accounts and anecdotes received by the narrator.\nThe novel\
  \ is often compared to the actual, contemporary accounts of the plague in the diary\
  \ of Samuel Pepys. Defoe's account, which appears to include much research, is far\
  \ more systematic and detailed than Pepys's first-person account.\n\n\n From Wikipedia\
